# Udacity Google Nanodegree Mobile Web Specialist Track

## Final Project - Stage 3

## Project Overview
For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage Three, you will take the connected application you yu built in Stage One and Stage Two and add additional functionality. You will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, youâ€™ll work to optimize your site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using Lighthouse.

## Getting Started
Go to (https://github.com/enginBozkurt/mws-restaurant-stage-3) , clone the backend and follow the instructions to run it
run npm i.
Serve the web app using gulp command.
Serve the main directory python -m http.server 8000

## Note about ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
